 * @brief Execute arbitrary functions on the main thread.
 *
 * An instance of this class should be created on the main thread and initialized with `initialize()`.
 * A corresponding number of worker threads can then be created using `std::thread`.
 * Each worker can request functions for main thread execution via `run()`.
 * The main thread should call `listen()` to wait for such requests, blocking until all workers have finished by calling `finish_thread()`.
 *
 * Outside of parallel contexts, the same class can be used to execute functions directly on the main thread by just calling `run()`.
 * It is not necessary to call `initialize()` beforehand, nor is it required to `listen()`, or to call `finish_thread()`.
 * This is helpful to enable the same code to be used in parallel and serial contexts.
