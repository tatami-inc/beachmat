Description: Provides a consistent C++ class interface for reading from and 
        writing data to a variety of commonly used matrix types. Ordinary 
        matrices and several sparse/dense Matrix classes are directly supported, 
        third-party S4 classes may be supported by external linkage, while all
        other matrices are handled by DelayedArray block processing.
