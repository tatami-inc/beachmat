Description: 
    Provides a consistent C++ class interface for reading from a variety of commonly used matrix types. 
    Ordinary matrices and several sparse/dense Matrix classes are directly supported, 
    along with a subset of the delayed operations implemented in the DelayedArray package.
    All other matrix-like objects are supported by calling back into R.
